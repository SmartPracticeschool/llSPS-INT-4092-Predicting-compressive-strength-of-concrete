# Predicting the compressive strength of concrete

This repository contains the files of the project that I developed during my internship tenure at SmartBridge

### Dataset
The dataset was taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository
It contains 1030 instances and 9 attributes with surprisingly no missing values.
Among the 8 input variables, 7 represent the raw materials and 1 represents age.
The target variable is Concrete Compressive Strength (obviously) which is messured in Mega Pascal(MPa).
